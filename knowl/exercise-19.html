<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose Bormit is at point \(Z\) in the hyperbolic plane, and he sees a road up ahead, which is a hyperbolic line \(l\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Model this scenario.  That is, construct an arbitrary hyperbolic line \(L\) in the hyperbolic plane and plot a point \(Z\) not on \(l\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Construct the hyperbolic line through \(Z\) that is orthogonal to \(l\text{.}\)  We don't have a tool that does this directly, but you can construct it by first reflecting \(Z\) across two well-chosen clines.  Let \(W\) be the point at which the two lines intersect.</li>
<li>The length of hyperbolic segment \(ZW\) represents the perpendicular distance of \(Z\) to \(l\) - it is the shortest distance Bormit can walk to reach the road.  Compute this distance, and call it \(d\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Suppose \(U\) is an ideal point of hyperbolic line \(l\text{.}\)  The angle \(\alpha = \angle ZWU\) is called the angle of parallelism of point \(Z\) to line \(l\text{.}\)  Determine the angle \(\alpha\text{.}\)</li>
<li>It turns out that in hyperbolic geometry, knowing \(\alpha\) fixes \(d\text{.}\)  That is, Bormit can determine his distance to line \(L\) by measuring the angle of parallelism.  In an input cell at left, enter \(-ln(tan(\alpha/2))\text{,}\) assuming your angle of parallelism has label \(\alpha\text{.}\)  Check that this value matches the hyperbolic distance from \(Z\) to \(W\text{.}\)  We can prove that in general,<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\tan(\alpha/2)= e^{-d}
\end{equation*}
</div>(we will do this later, not now).</li>
<li>Download your workbook as a .ggb file entitled parallelism_yourname.ggb and add it to your homework folder.</li>
