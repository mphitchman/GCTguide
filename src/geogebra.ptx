      Geogebra offers dynamic compass and ruler constructions on-line.  We use this program often in our investigations.  Indeed much of the key developments in the text rely on compass and ruler constructions, and to understand them we need to get in and work with them.

      You can access Geogebra apps, which are free to use, in a few ways. Click on the <c>Calc</c> button near the top of this page to open a Geogebra window on the right of this screen.  This can be handy from time to time.  You can also open the Geogebra apps at their website <url href="https://www.geogebra.org">geogebra.org</url>.    
    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of good Geogebra demonstrations are available in their gallery.  We will use some demonstrations specific to this text as well.  For class activities, it will be best to use Geogebra from their website rather than from the calculator embedded on this page, if only because the working window on your screen is likely bigger.

<worksheet><title>Geogebra Worksheet 1: Constructing Symmetric Points</title>
      <p>
        At <url href="https://www.geogebra.org">geogebra.org</url> look for the list of apps under the heading <em>Powerful Math Apps</em>.  For this we want to use the app <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/geometry">geometry</url>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you open the Geometry app, you should see a blank canvas on the right and a pallette of tools on the left.  We will want more than the basic tools, so click on <em>MORE</em> to see them all.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To familiarize yourself with this app, work through the following constructions.
      </p>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Construct a circle.  Label the center of the circle <m>Z_0</m>. Label the circle itself as <m>c</m>.  One quirk with Geogebra is that points must be labelled by capital letters, and lines and circles must be labelled by lower case letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            To change an object's label, click the <em>Move</em> tool and select the object.  A window should appear with a text box.  Click that to change the label.  To get <m>Z_0</m> type <em>Z_0</em>. 
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>

      <exercise><title>Construct <m>z^*</m> if <m>z</m> is inside the circle</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            In this exercise we construct the point symmetric to <m>Z</m> with respect to the circle <m>c</m> where <m>Z</m> is inside the circle.
            <ol label="a.">
              <li>
                Construct a point inside the circle, and label it <m>Z</m>.  Then construct the ray <m>\vec{Z_0Z}</m>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Construct the line perpendicular to ray <m>\vec{Z_0Z}</m> at the point <m>Z</m>.  Call this line <m>m</m> (lines get lower case letters).
              </li>
              <li>
                With the point tool selected, define one of the points at which <m>m</m> intersects the circle and label this point <m>T</m>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Construct segment <m>Z_0T</m> and then construct the line perpendicular to this segment at <m>T</m>.  Call this line <m>n</m>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Define the point at which line <m>n</m> intersects ray <m>\overrightarrow{Z_0Z}</m>.  This is the point symmetric to <m>Z</m> with respect to circle <m>c</m>.  Label this point <m>Z_s</m>.
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p> 
        </statement>
      </exercise>
      <exercise><title>Hide intermediate constructions</title>  
        <statement>
          <p>
            Select the Show/Hide Object tool and click on these intermediate constructions: ray <m>\vec{Z_0Z}</m>, lines <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, the point <m>T</m>, and segment <m>Z_0T</m>.  Now click on the Move tool (or another tool).  Those objects (and hopefully nothing else) will disappear.  To get them to reappear, click on the Show/Hide Object tool again.  The objects marked for hiding will appear faiter than the other objects.  Note:  If you simply delete these objects all other objects depending on them (like <m>Z_s</m>) will vanish too and we donâ€™t want that!!
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>

      <p>
        Congratulations!!  You constructed the point symmetric to <m>Z</m> with respect to <m>c</m>.  Now click on the Move tool and drag the point <m>Z</m> around inside the circle.  Admire how <m>Z^*</m> follows dutifully around and is always the point symmetric to <m>Z</m>.  Notice how <m>Z</m> and <m>Z_s</m> get closer together as you near the circle, and how <m>Z_s</m> rushes excitedly toward infinity, like a dog wanting to please its master, as <m>Z</m> marches toward <m>Z_0</m>.  What happens if <m>Z</m> moves outside the circle?  Can you construct <m>Z_s</m> if <m>Z</m> is outside <m>c</m>?
      </p>

      <exercise><title>Construct <m>z^*</m> if <m>z</m> is outside the circle</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Move <m>Z</m> outside the circle and complete these steps.
          <ol label="a.">
              <li> 
                Construct the circle having diameter <m>Z_0Z</m>.  Plot a point  at which this circle intersects <m>c</m> and label this point  <m>T</m>.
                <hint> Begin by finding the midpoint of segment <m>Z_0Z</m>.</hint>
              </li>
              <li>
                Construct the perpendicular to <m>Z_0Z</m> through <m>T</m>. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Let <m>Z_s</m> be the intersection of this perpendicular with segment <m>Z_0Z</m>.
              </li>
              <li> 
                Hide intermediate constructions so that only <m>Z</m> and <m>Z_s</m> remain.  If you move <m>Z</m> back inside the circle, the <q>other</q> <m>Z_s</m> should still reappear.  Check to make sure.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>
      <exercise><title>The symmetry point tool</title>
      	<statement>
      		<p>
      			Now that you know how to construct symmetric points whether <m>Z</m> is inside or outside a circle, I would like to point out that Geogebra has a ready-made tool for finding symmetry points, the reflect across a circle tool.  We will use this tool to speed up future constructions that involve symmetry points, especially constructions in the hyperbolic plane of Chapter 5.

            <li>
              Plot three points labelled <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>Z</m> on your canvas.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the perpendicular bisector tool construct the perpendicular bisector between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, and the perpendicular bisector between <m>P</m> and <m>Z</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct the point at which these perpendicular bisectors intersect, label this point <m>O</m>.

            <li>
              Construct the circle centered at <m>O</m> through <m>Z</m>.  This is the type I cline of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> through <m>Z</m>.

            <li>
              Hide intermediate constructions so that all we see on the canvas are the three points <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>Z</m>, and the type I cline of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> through <m>Z</m>.  Drag <m>Z</m> around to check the dynamic nature of your construction.  
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Two comments: First, this construction assumes <m>Z</m> is not on the line through <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  (If <m>Z</m> is on this line, then the type I cline of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> through <m>Z</m> is this line.)  Second, <em>Geogebra</em> has a tool for constructing this cline, the tool <q>circle through 3 points</q>.

          <p>
            Two comments: First, the construction of the type II cline also assumes <m>Z</m> is not on the line through <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  Second, <em>Geogebra</em> does not have a built-in tool for constructing type II clines, but we can create a custom tool that achieves this.  More on this below.

    <p>
      Remark: The file you open in the next worksheet has this type II cline construction saved as a custom tool.  You can create your own custom tools in <em>Geogebra Classic</em> (but not other Geogebra Apps, as far as I know). A custom tool is super useful if you expect to repeat a particular construction often in a <em>Geogebra</em> project.  Very roughly to create a custom tool based on a construction you've done in <em>Geogebra Classic</em>, begin by selecting the <em>tools</em> option from the main drop-down menu, (the three bars icon in the upper right portion of the <em>Geogebra</em> window).

            Suppose <m>U</m> is an ideal point of hyperbolic line <m>l</m>.  The angle <m>\alpha = \angle ZWU</m> is called the angle of parallelism of point <m>Z</m> to line <m>l</m>.  Determine the angle <m>\alpha</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            It turns out that in hyperbolic geometry, knowing <m>\alpha</m> fixes <m>d</m>.  That is, Bormit can determine his distance to line <m>L</m> by measuring the angle of parallelism.  In an input cell at left, enter <m>-ln(tan(\alpha/2))</m>, assuming your angle of parallelism has label <m>\alpha</m>.  Check that this value matches the hyperbolic distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>W</m>.  We can prove that in general, <me>\tan(\alpha/2)= e^{-d}</me> (we will do this later, not now).

    <exercise><title>Hyperbolic Right Triangles</title>
        <statement>
          <ol label="a.">
            <li>
              Open a new copy of <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic/bbuxpqrv">hyperbolic tools</url>
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct a right triangle in the hyperbolic plane, avoiding the origin (use the custom tools!).  Build the triangle in such a way that it stays a right triangle if the points are moved around.
            </li>
            <li>
              Determine the lengths of the three sides of this triangle.  Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> denote the leg lengths, and <m>c</m> denote the hypotenuse length.
            </li>
            <li>
              Does <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>?  If not, which is bigger, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> or <m>c^2</m>? Is this always the case as the triangle moves around?
            </li>
            <li>
              One way to tackle the previous question would be to input <m>a^2 + b^2 - c^2</m> into a cell to see whether we get a positive, negative, or 0 value (and then move points around to see if this changes).  In a new input cell, type <m>\cosh(a)\cdot \cosh(b)-\cosh(c)</m>.  What value does this take as you move the triangle around?
            </li>
            <li>
              Yes, we can prove that in a hyperbolic right triangle with side lengths <m>a, b</m> and hypotenuse <m>c</m>, <m>\cosh(a)\cosh(b)=\cosh(c)</m>.

    <exercise><title>BONUS: Construct the hyperbolic circle centered at <m>p</m> with radius <m>r</m></title>
    <statement>
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          Plot a point <m>p</m> in the hyperbolic plane, and set <m>r=4</m> in an input cell (which should create a slider for <m>r</m> - we can <m>0 \leq r \leq 5</m>, say.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Can you determine the value of the scalar <m>k</m> so that <m>d_H(kp,p)=r</m>?  Your answer should be of the formula for <m>k</m> that depends on <m>r</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you work that out algebraically, then one can compute <m>k</m> in Geogebra using your formula, then plot the scalar <m>kp</m>, and then plot the hyperbolic circle centered at <m>p</m> with radius <m>r</m>.
