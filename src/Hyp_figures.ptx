      <exercise><title>The hyperbolic line through <m>p</m> and <m>q</m></title>
        <statement>
          <ol label="a.">
            <li>
              Plot two points in <m>\mathbb{D}</m>, and label them <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the <q>reflect about circle</q> tool to plot <m>P^\prime</m>, the point symmetric to <m>P</m> with respect to the unit circle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct the circle through <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>P^\prime</m>, call this circle <m>c</m>.  The hyperbolic line through <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> is the portion of this circle inside <m>\mathbb{D}</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plot the two ideal points of the hyperbolic line through <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, and label these points <m>U</m> and <m>V</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct the hyperbolic line through <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, and then hide all intermediate constructions, so that we just see <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, the hyperbolic line through them, and the ideal points <m>U</m> and <m>V</m>.  Drag <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> around to make sure your construction works dynamically.

      <exercise><title>Constructing the hyperbolic circle centered at <m>P</m> through <m>Q</m>.</title>
        <statement>
          <ol label="a.">
            <li>
              Given the two points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> in <m>\mathbb{D}</m>, show again <m>P^\prime</m>, the point symmetric to <m>P</m> with respect to the unit circle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Construct the type II cline of <m>P</m> and <m>P^\prime</m> that goes through <m>Q</m>. (See xxx for this construction).
              This is the hyperbolic circle centered at <m>P</m> through <m>Q</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hide intermediate constructions, so that you just see on the canvas the three points <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>Z</m>, the type I cline of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> through <m>Z</m>, and the type II cline of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> through <m>Z</m>.

            One comments: The file you opened had this type II cline construction saved as a <q>custom tool</q>.  Instead of having to repeat this type II cline construction from scratch each time we want to build a hyperbolic circle, we can use the custom tool as in the following exercise.

    <exercise><title>There need not exist a hyperbolic circle through three points in <m>(\mathbb{D},{\cal H})</m>.</title>
    <statement>
      <ol label="a.">
        <li>
          Hide all constructions execpt <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and the perpendicular bisector of <m>PQ</m>.  Then plot a new point, label it <m>T</m>.

        <li>
          Find positions for <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>T</m> inside <m>\mathbb{D}</m> in which these three perpendicular bisectors do not intersect.
        </li>
        <li>
          For points in such positions, convince yourself that no hyperbolic circle will go through these three points.
